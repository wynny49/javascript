    <h4>About Wynny Photograpy</h4>
    <p>
        Wynny Photography idea was birth far back in the university days during our free periods of no lectures, i had a
        photographer friend who does commercials and basically passports at then soft copies had not started surfacing,
        i picked interest in his camera and he started teaching me how to use it, i helped him take some passports as
        customers were begining to appreciate the fact that a lady would have to do the capturing,i learnt to use the
        camera and do basic snapping.
    </p>
    After graduating, myself and few friends left for the batch A service stream, on returning from service 2018, i
    actively joined politics and pushed my support of a candidate running for the house of representatives introduced by
    a brother, we started his media team and along the line we acquainted him on the need to purchase an actual camera
    as phone cameras were no longer doing the needful. He got the camera and i told the team i could handle the
    capturing.
    <p>
        I started capturing moments from there and mastering the use of a camera, then i needed to add editing to it to
        make my work look better so i met an old school mate, who does photography well to editing so she could put me
        through, it took one angry night for me to learn what i couldnt learn in months out of anger and zeal, after a
        wedding i was looked down on.
